<h3>Salmon & cucumber sushi rolls</h3>
<p>Yum, low-fat and healthy Japanese sushi</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 nori sheets</li>
    <li>Â¼ cucumber</li>
    <li>wasabi</li>
    <li>sushi ginger</li>
    <li>light soy sauce</li>
    <li>salmon roe</li>
    <li>sushi rice</li>
    <li>rice vinegar</li>
    <li>sake/mirin (optional)</li>
    <li>sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First, make the rice. Rinse the sushi rice in a colander, massaging it with your hands until the water runs clear. Leave to drain for 15 mins.</li>
    <li>Put the rice in a saucepan with 200ml water and the sake or mirin, if using. Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 mins until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat. Set aside, covered, for 15-20 mins.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a large bowl. Dissolve the sugar, if using, in the vinegar with a good pinch of salt, pour over the rice and mix. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
    <li>Put 1 nori sheet on a bamboo mat and cover the surface with half of the cooled rice. Lay half of the salmon and cucumber slices along the length of the rice in a strip, being careful not to overfill it. Run a pea-sized blob of wasabi (more if you like it really hot) along the edge of the filling with your finger.</li>
    <li>Roll up tightly and squeeze to seal when you reach the end. Repeat with the remaining nori, salmon and cucumber, and more wasabi. Slice each roll into 6 pieces, and serve with extra wasabi, ginger, soy sauce and salmon roe, if you like. Will keep in the fridge for 1 day.</li>
